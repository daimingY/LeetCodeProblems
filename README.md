  - Using Backtracking
- Combination Sum
- Combination Sum II
- Multiply Strings
- First Missing Positive
  - Though the array is given unsorted, linear runtime possible by swaping numbers into correct places
- Permutations
  - Using Backtracking
- Permutations II
  - Using Backtracking
- Rotate Image
  - Greedy Algorithm, O(1) space, O(n^2) runtime, as input size being a n^2 square matrix
- Group Anagrams
  - Using sort and hash map, achieve O(nklogk). Note: n is number of words, k is max length of a word.
- Pow(x,n)
  - O(log(n)), linear runtime, as n passed in as a number value, and considering multiplication as O(1).
- Wildcard Matching
  - DP solution, O(mn)
- N-Queens
  - Use Backtracking with information stored in 1-D Array
- N-Queens II
  - Same as above, except return the total number
